# PHP LESS compiler

Compile LESS into CSS with ease.

## LESS features support

I write this project, first of all, *for myself*.
That means that I won't implement features that I don't need (and there is a bunch of them).
If you're interested in my work and want to contribute - you're welcome!

### What is NOT supported

- extending
- mixin and CSS guards
- loops
- merging
- some small features related to mixins

### What is supported

- variables (scopes, interpolating) [x]
- mixins (selectors, namespaces, parametric) [ ]
- nested rules [x]
- importing [ ]
- parent selector (&) [x]
- comments [x]
